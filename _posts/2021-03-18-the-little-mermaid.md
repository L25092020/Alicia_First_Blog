> On Christmas 2019, I came to Denmark, which I have always wanted to visit.
Copenhagen is also one of the European cities I want to visit most. Here, the little mermaid statue can be regarded as Copenhagen's business card.

A park in the shape of a five-pointed star. There are very few people here in theearly morning, and only some local residents running here.

#### Sculpture near the park
Denmark is a country that pays great attention to environmental protection. Such sculptures are made of waste metal materials, which also convey the environmental protection concept of waste utilization.
