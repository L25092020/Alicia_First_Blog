#### My childhood dream
I have been interested in mathematics and physics since I was a child, because they are ways to explore the essence of matter.  When I was young, I liked to solve the problems of logical thinking and spatial imagination.

When I took an airplane for the first time, I was curious why the airplane can fly in the air, why it can rise and fall, and why it can fly at a certain speed.
